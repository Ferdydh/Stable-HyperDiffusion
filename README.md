Hey, it's ferdy. I'm writing some instructions I'll need over and over again.

1. If you installed some libraries, export for reproducibility: `conda env export --no-builds > environment.yaml`
2.

IF YOU ARE RUNNING `python main.py` in lhdm, the path to data is `data/mnist-inrs`
IF YOU ARE RUNNING `python lhdm/main.py` in root, the path to data is `lhdm/data/mnist-inrs`
